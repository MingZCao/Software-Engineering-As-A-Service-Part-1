Part 1:
Define a method sum which takes an array of integers as an argument and returns the sum of its elements. For an empty array it should return zero.
Define a method max_2_sum which takes an array of integers as an argument and returns the sum of its two largest elements. For an empty array it should return zero. For an array with just one element, it should return that element.
Define a method sum_to_n? which takes an array of integers and an additional integer, n, as arguments and returns true if any two distinct elements in the array of integers sum to n. An empty array or single element array should both return false.




Part 2:
Define a method hello(name) that takes a string representing a name and returns the string "Hello, " concatenated with the name.
Define a method starts_with_consonant?(s) that takes a string and returns true if it starts with a consonant and false otherwise. (For our purposes, a consonant is any letter other than A, E, I, O, U.) NOTE: be sure it works for both upper and lower case and for nonletters!
Define a method binary_multiple_of_4?(s) that takes a string and returns true if the string represents a binary number that is a multiple of 4. NOTE: be sure it returns false if the string is not a valid binary number!
